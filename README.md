## Project Description
Project to make the sales data of a company more accessible from one centralised location. The first step is to produce a system to store the current company data in a database so that it is accessed from one centralised location and act as a single source for all sales data. The second part is to query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

## Installation Instructions
To install and run this project:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have a 'db_creds.yaml' and 'local_db_creds.yaml' file so that you can access the database in your root system
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
4. Configure your environment
4. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Usage Instructions
To use the program:

1. Run the script by typing 'python __main__.py' in your terminal
2. Once this has run you can then run 'database.sql' to make adjustments to the database
3. Each of the files in the 'queries' folder can be run to access the data

## File Structure

- `__main__.py`: This is the main Python script that you run to run through the program.
- `data_cleaning.py`: This is the Python script that performs the cleaning of the different data.
