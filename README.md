## Project Description
Project to make the sales data of a company more accessible from one centralised location. The first step is to produce a system to store the current company data in a database so that it is accessed from one centralised location and act as a single source for all sales data. The second part is to query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

## Installation Instructions
To install and run this project:

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine
```
    git clone https://github.com/B-M-S-West/multinational-retail-data-centralisation.git
```
2. Make sure you have a 'db_creds.yaml' and 'local_db_creds.yaml' file so that you can access the database in your root system
-   Create a YAML file for each
-   Add the following content to each and replace with the database credentials
```
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
    host: your_host
    port: your_port
    database: your_database
```
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
4. Configure your environment
    Required python packages - Pandas, Numpy, boto3, pyyaml, sqlalchemy, tabula, requests, os
5. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Usage Instructions
To use the program:

1. Run the script by using the following in your terminal
```
    python __main__.py
```
2. Once this has run you can then run 'database.sql' to make adjustments to the database
3. Each of the files in the 'queries' folder can be run to access the data

## File Structure
The project has the following structure:

- `__main__.py`: This is the main Python script that you run to run through the program.
- `data_cleaning.py`: This is the Python script that performs the cleaning of the different data.
- `data_extraction.py`: This is the Python script that performs the extraction of the data from the different sources.
- `database_utils.py`: This is the Python script that connects to the database and uploads
- `db_creds.yaml`: This contains the details to access the original database
- `local_db_creds.yaml`: This contains the details to access the database on the local area 
- `database.sql`: This contains the SQL statements that make the alterations to the table and set primary and foreign keys
- `queries`: folder containing the following file that each query the database to answer different questions:
    - `task_1_number_of_stores.sql`: How many stores do the business have and in which countries?
    - `task_2_number_of_stores_in_region.sql`: Which locations have the most stores?
    - `task_3_number_of_sales_per_month.sql`: Which months produce the most sales overall time of records?
    - `task_4_online_vs_offline.sql`: How many sales come online?

    - `task_9_average_time_to_get_an_order.sql`: How quickly the company is making sales?
